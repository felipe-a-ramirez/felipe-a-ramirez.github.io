I am the faculty contact for [[https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/][Wesleyan’s Directed Reading Program]]
(DRP). The DRP is a program that pairs graduate students and
undergraduate students for semester-long reading projects in a variety
of areas of mathematics. It is a wonderful opportunity for students at
all levels to explore special areas of mathematics deeply.
